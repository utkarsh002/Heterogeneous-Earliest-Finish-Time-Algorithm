# Heterogeneous-Earliest-Finish-Time-Algorithm
Implementation of Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time algorithm in functional programming language and object oriented language.
Steps to Compile:

It is highly recommended to run and compile the program on linux system.

If there are more than 500 tasks then array size in both the code is to be increased accordingly.

1)Remove all the comments from the input file.

2)Download the clisp (sudo apt-get install clisp) and g++ (sudo apt-get install g++) compiler. 

3)To compile .cpp file use the following commands on the console (terminal)
    a)g++ filename.cpp
    b)./a.out
        This command will take manual input from the console(terminal) and the result will be displayed on the screen.
    c)./a.out < inputfilename.txt
        This command will take the input from the file inputfile.txt and output will be displayed on the screen.
    d)./a.out < inputfile.txt > outputfile.dat
        This command will take the input from the inputfile.txt and result will be stored in outputfile.dat.

4)To compile .lisp file use the following commands on the console (terminal)
    a)clisp filename.lisp
        This command will take the manual input from the console and output will be displayed on the console.
    b)clisp filename.lisp < inputfile.txt
        This command will take the input from the inputfile.txt and the result will e displayed on the screen.
    c)clisp filename.lisp < inputfile.txt > outputfile.dat
        This command will take the input from the inputfile.txt and result will be stored in outputfile.dat.

Output format is same as it was explined in the pdf.
